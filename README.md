You will need to install selenium through pip (pip intsall selenium)  
Make sure your pip version is updated

Downlaod GecoDriver from here https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases  
and a web driver  
Chrome webdriver from here http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads (make sure to check your chrome version)  

If you are using windows, unzip the files and copy the .exe to your python folder  
For me it is in C:\Users\INTEL\AppData\Local\Programs\Python
